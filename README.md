## Project
The Port of Portland is the port district responsible for management of the Portland
International Airport, located at 45.5898° N, 122.5951° W. The port’s engineering
directors are evaluating the demands on the airport’s existing HVAC system, assessing
whether it needs replacement. Currently, the HVAC system is set such that the air-
conditioning system is turned on when the outdoor temperature is over 75 degrees
Fahrenheit. Similarly, the heating system is turned on when the outdoor temperature is
under 62 degrees Fahrenheit.
The engineering directors want to learn how often the air-conditioning and heating
systems were turned on for July 2020. In particular, they would like a summary of data
that provides the following:

• For each day in the given date range, indicate whether the air-conditioning
system was turned on at least once.
• For each day in the given date range, indicate whether the heating system was
turned on at least once.

Create a Restful API with the following specifications:
• Fetch data for a month indicated by the web report
• Transform data
• Return JSON formatted data
• (Optional) Present the results in a UI

## Installation

* Built on .NET framework 4.7
* Uses gemboxsoftware link contains instructions to download into visual studio using (https://www.gemboxsoftware.com/document/examples/c-sharp-vb-net-word-pdf-library/801) for creating and manipulating .docx documents.

## How It Works

1. Download through git or download zip file and unpack onto laptop
2. Open project file (\WindowsFormsApp2\WindowsFormsApp2.csproj) from visual studio
3. Start the software.
4. Popup Opens as seen here, In order for the bold to work it must map to a word in the content textbox. To get multiple words bolded seperate then by "," in the content bold textbox. Then after clicking search you will see the text changed to bold. Click the reset to change the content.

<div align="center"><img width="650" src="demomainscreen-addtodocument.jpg"></div>

7. Find the document named powerpoint.pptx inside \WindowsFormsApp2\bin\Debug
